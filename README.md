# PyTDA - Topological Data Analysis (TDA) for Python
## Introduction
PyTDA contains Python codes that demonstrate the numerical calculation
of algebraic topology in an application to topological data analysis 
(TDA).

Topological data analysis aims at studying the shapes of the data, and
draw some insights from them. A lot of machine learning algorithms deal 
with distances, which are extremely useful, but they miss the 
information the data may carry from their geometry.

## Demo Codes and Blog Entries
Codes in this repository are demo codes for a few entries of my blog,
